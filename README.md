# No nitro upsell
This removes ALL of Discord's nitro upsells by tricking the client into thinking you have nitro.  Works with Replugged and Powercord.

[Install in Replugged](https://replugged.dev/install?url=asportnoy/powercord-no-nitro-upsell)

## Notes
⚠️ THIS DOES NOT GIVE YOU ACCESS TO NITRO FEATURES. THOSE ARE RESTRICTED SERVER-SIDE. ⚠️
